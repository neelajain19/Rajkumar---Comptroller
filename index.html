			<span class="name"><b>J</b></span>enifer Rajkumar, the second-term New York State Democratic Assemblywoman from Queens and <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2023/08/highly-visible-alliance-between-assembly-member-jenifer-rajkumar-and-mayor-eric-adams/389690/" target="_blank">ally</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/nyregion/eric-adams-indicted.html" target="_blank">currently embattled New York City Mayor Eric Adams</a>, is vying to be the City’s next Comptroller. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b8MGT_tmmY" target="_blank">Her announcement</a> came in the late summer on the heels of current <a href="https://www.landerfornyc.com" target="_blank">City Comptroller Brad Lander’s declaration</a> that he will challenge Adams in the Mayoral Democratic primary next year. Other candidates who have since joined the Comptroller race include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyW1WzripAsManhattan" target="blank">Borough President Mark Levine</a> and <a href="https://justinbrannan.com/" target="blank">Brooklyn City Councilman Justin Brannan</a>. Of course, with the unveiling of last month’s federal criminal corruption charges against the Mayor, the Comptroller race is bound to be shook up should Adams resign or be forced to step down triggering a special election.  
		</p>

		<p>
			In the meanwhile, let’s talk about what we know so far about Rajkumar, an ever ubiquitous presence in her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepoliticalpersonality_/reel/C2IVe4vPV9N/" target="blank">trademark red dress</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd2CLfroN3Y" target="_blank">(she owns over 50 of them!)</a> at Mayor Adams’ side during city events. Representing District 38 <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jenifer-Rajkumar/map/" target="_blank">(Glendale, Ozone Park, Richmond Hill, Ridgewood and Woodhaven)</a> in Queens since 2021, the 42-year old <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Jenifer-Rajkumar/about/" target="_blank">former professor and civil rights attorney was the first South-Asian American woman elected to state office in New York</a>. Her legislative accomplishments include the <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A00628&term=&Summary=Y" target="_blank"> designation of Diwali as a New York City public school holiday</a>, the <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A09114&leg_video=" target="_blank">establishment of license, inspection and insurance requirements for e-bikes and e-scooters</a>, and the <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A08428&leg_video=" target="_blank">passing of the SMOKEOUT Act</a>, a bill which grants state municipalities the right to close unlicensed cannabis shops. 
		</p>

		<p>
			As for her candidacy for Comptroller though?  In the two months since her announcement, she hasn’t provided much in the way of specifics from a policy perspective regarding what she would do as Comptroller, a role that traditionally serves as the financial watchdog of the Mayor, overseeing city spending and auditing city agencies. But let’s take a look at what she has said so far about her campaign and where she stands on the issues that matter most to New Yorkers.

		<h2> Eyeing the Comptroller Role </h2>
	</section>

			

	<section class="content-block">
			<h3> On...why she’s running: </h3>
			<p>
				Rajkumar has consistently pointed to government inefficiency as the motivating factor for her run for Comptroller saying [it] <a href="https://pix11.com/video/assemblymember-rajkumar-on-running-for-comptroller/9960382/" target="_blank">“costs lives and I can fix it.  This is what I do. I fix things.”</a> 
			</p>
	</section>

	<section class="content-block">
			<h3> On...her experience: </h3>
			<p>
				Rajkumar has relied on her experience as a lawyer and within government to make the case that she is ready to protect the City’s fiscal health and eliminate waste and wrong-doing within City government. <a href="https://pix11.com/video/assemblymember-rajkumar-on-running-for-comptroller/9960382/" target="_blank">“I held big corporations accountable at the national level rooting out corporate fraud,”</a> she has said.  She has also referenced the development of a <a href="https://pix11.com/video/assemblymember-rajkumar-on-running-for-comptroller/9960382/" target="_blank">“first in the nation $31 million dollar”</a> program that helped immigrants receive legal services while Director of Immigration Affairs for New York State as further evidence of her abilities to ensure government programs work.  She also points to her work passing <a href=" https://www.nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A08864&leg_video=" target="_blank">legislation</a> reforming the process for public notice and comment within the City’s procurement system calling it <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gotham-gazette-max-murphy/jenifer-rajkumar-joined-the-show-to-discuss-her-top-priorities" target="_blank">"a major win.”</a>  
			</p>

			<h3> On...serving as a check to her ally, Mayor Adams:
			</h3>
			<p>
			Prior to Mayor Adams’ indictment, Rajkumar stated that she is interested in being a different type of Comptroller, working to <a href="https://pix11.com/video/assemblymember-rajkumar-on-running-for-comptroller/9960382/" target="_blank">“hold the Mayor accountable, but in a way that is constructive and that actually makes government programs work.”</a> She also has said that she and the Mayor disagree on issues frequently, which helps to facilitate more productive discussions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Following the indictment, Rajkumar released a statement, choosing (as was expected) not to join the growing chorus of city officials demanding the Mayor's resignation: 
		</p>

		<h2> The Issues </h2>

	<section class="content-block">
			<h3> On...congestion pricing: </h3>
			<p>
				Rajkumar has said she agrees that the MTA is in need of funds to support transit capital projects, but she’s not entirely convinced that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gotham-gazette-max-murphy/jenifer-rajkumar-joined-the-show-to-discuss-her-top-priorities" target="_blank">“burdening working people with enormous tolls”</a>, particularly those in the outer boros, such as in her district, is the way to do it. She has stated that her and her fellow legislative colleagues must find more innovative ways to raise money for the MTA while congestion pricing is paused.  In the meanwhile however, she believes the MTA must <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gotham-gazette-max-murphy/jenifer-rajkumar-joined-the-show-to-discuss-her-top-priorities" target="_blank">“inspire more competence, trust and transparency”</a> in the public. 
			</p>
	</section>

<section class="content-block">
			<h3> On...the migrant crisis: </h3>
			<p>
				Rajkumar has been vocal that she firmly believes New York state must take ownership in resolving the migrant crisis. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gotham-gazette-max-murphy/jenifer-rajkumar-joined-the-show-to-discuss-her-top-priorities" target="_blank">“It is not just NYC’s problem. The state needs to lead. It is draining the social net of our city,”</a> she has said. She has also proposed a <a href="https://www.nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A08037&leg_video=" target="_blank">bill</a> that mandates state work authorizations for migrants thus giving the state the ability to issue work permits in the absence of federal legislation. She has also introduced a <a href="https://www.nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A07493&leg_video=" target="_blank">bill</a> that would create a position at the state level to coordinate asylum seeker services including legal assistance and healthcare. 
			</p>
	</section>

	<section class="content-block">
	<section class="last">
			<h3> On...managing the City's pension funds: </h3>
			<p>
				Rajkumar has said that as fiduciary of the City’s public pension funds she would return to a standard portfolio of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd2CLfroN3Y" target="_blank">60% global stocks and 40% bonds and also focus on removing fund managers who are not performing optimally</a>.  She has also stated that she is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd2CLfroN3Y" target="_blank">strong supporter of the state of Israel and would not divest from Israeli bonds</a>. She acknowledged, however, the importance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd2CLfroN3Y" target="_blank">“operating under certain morals and standards”</a> and, as such, would not invest in big oil.
